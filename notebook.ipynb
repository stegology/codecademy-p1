    "This code is analyzing the data from a file called `'codecademy-insurance.csv'` which contains information about insurance charges for different clients. It first imports the csv module and creates an empty list called `codecademy_insurance`. The code then opens the csv file and reads each row of data into a `dictionary` in the `list`. \n",

    "Next, it creates a function called `average()` which returns the sum of a list of numbers divided by the length of the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code then creates two empty lists, `male_charges` and `female_charges`, and iterates over the list of dictionaries. It checks the value of the `'sex'` key in each dictionary and, depending on the value, appends the corresponding `'charges'` value to the appropriate list. \n",
    "\n",
    "It then calculates the average of each list and prints a message comparing the two averages depending on which is larger."
